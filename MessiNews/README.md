# About This Project
Web scraping, often called web crawling or web spidering, or “programmatically going over a collection of web pages and extracting data,” <br> is a powerful tool for working with data on the web.
With a web scraper, we can mine data about a set of products,<br> get a large corpus of text or quantitative data to play around with, get data from a site without an official API,<br> or just satisfy own personal curiosity.
# Core Concepts
In this project, we crawl the Goal site to receive news related to Lionel Messi and save it in Jason's file.
<br>
At the end we can visualize data and do some model on it
